title: Reusable graphic panels
---

The interactive data visualizations produced by R/qtlcharts are
constructed from a series of reusable graphics panels, following
[Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike)'s
[Towards Reuseable Charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/).

The intent is for these panel functions to be usable by others, for
other purposes, along the lines of
[d3.Chart](http://misoproject.com/d3-chart/), towards which I intend
to move.
