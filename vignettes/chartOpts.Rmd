## Use of `chartOpts` to customize R/qtlcharts interactive graphs

There are a number of ways in which one may wish to customize the
interactive graphs produced by
[R/qtlcharts](http://kbroman.github.io/qtlcharts), such as different
colors or axis labels. Our main approach to allow such customization
is through a function argument, `chartOpts`.
