# R/qtlcharts Developer Guide

[R/qtlcharts](http://kbroman.github.io/qtlcharts) is an R package 
[R](http://www.r-project.org) package to create interactive charts for
QTL data, for use with [R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org). 
R/qtlcharts is written in
[R](http://www.r-project.org) and
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), making use of the JavaScript
libraries [D3](http://d3js.org) and
[d3-tip](https://github.com/caged/d3-tip), as well as
(ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org).

The aim of this guide is to explain the basic strategy of the package
and the organization of the code, in the hope that others may wish to
contribute to its development or to make use of different pieces of
the software.

## Basic layout of source

The source for the package is at
[GitHub](http://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts).  The
[`devel` branch](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/devel)
contains the current development version, but it is not far ahead (if
at all) from the
[`master` branch](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master).

JavaScript and CoffeeScript code are within the
[`inst/`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst)
subdirectory. (When the package is _installed_, the contents of the
`inst` directory are moved up one level, and there is no `inst`
directory anymore.)

The three main libraries are in
[`inst/d3`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/d3),
[`inst/d3-tip`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/d3-tip)
and
[`inst/colorbrewer`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/colorbrewer).

The interactive charts are built on a set of
[reuseable D3-based graphic panels](http://kbroman.github.io/qtlcharts/pages/panels.html),
contained in
[`inst/panels`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/panels).
These were designed following
[Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike)'s
[Towards Reuseable Charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/).
[`panelutil.coffee`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/panels/panelutil.coffee)
contains various utility functions used by one or more panels and
[`panelutil.css`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/panels/panelutil.css)
contains CSS code for the panels. The actual panels are in
subdirectories of
[`inst/panels`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/panels),
and each contains a `test` subdirectory with test code.

The higher-level charts are located in
[`inst/charts`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/tree/master/inst/charts). 
This is where most of the interactivity is encoded.
[`charts.css`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/blob/master/inst/charts/charts.css)
contains a bit of CSS code for the charts.


## CoffeeScript

I've chosen to develop the charts in
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) rather than JavaScript,
thought the CoffeeScript code is translated to JavaScript and it is
the JavaScript that is ultimately used.

The CoffeeScript code is not that far from JavaScript: the bulk of the
code is basically not different. So why add this extra layer, with
CoffeeScript? I just like it better. CoffeeScript is a nicer language
and is more fun to code.

[D3](http://d3js.org) code generally includes a lot of anonymous
functions, like 

    blah.attr("x", function(d) { return xscale(d); });
    
In CoffeeScript, this becomes

    blah.attr("x", (d) -> xscale(d))

Also, in dealing with missing values, or with default values,
CoffeeScript has some features that make life easier. Here's an
example:
 
    height = chartOpts?.height ? 450

The JavaScript version of this is cumbersome and ugly.

inserted, as JSON.

using the ruby script
[`grab_chartOpts.rb`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/blob/master/vignettes/chartOpts/grab_chartOpts.rb).

Some charts have multiple versions; the file [`multiversions.csv`](https://github.com/kbroman/qtlcharts/blob/master/vignettes/chartOpts/multiversions.csv)
lists the chart name and a bit of Markdown code to describe the
version. Also, the order of the charts in the
[chartOpts vignette](http://kbroman.github.io/qtlcharts/assets/vignettes/chartOpts.html)
is determined from the order in this file.
