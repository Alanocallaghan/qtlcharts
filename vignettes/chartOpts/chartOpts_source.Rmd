# List of chart customization options

There are a number of ways in which one may wish to customize the
interactive graphs produced by
[R/qtlcharts](http://kbroman.github.io/qtlcharts), such as different
colors or axis labels. Our main approach to allow such customization
is through a function argument, `chartOpts`. 

Use of these options is described in the
[R/qtlcharts User Guide](http://kbroman.github.io/qtlcharts/assets/vignettes/userGuide.html).

The following is a complete listing of the
customization options for each chart.
